## Features

- Utilizes Python programming language.
- Incorporates machine learning techniques for stellar data analysis.
- Focuses on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram for star classification.
- Provides a systematic approach to categorize stars based on observable features.

## Objective

The overarching objective of the StarryNight project is to construct a star classification system using machine learning techniques acquired during the course of the Machine Learning curriculum. By doing so, the project aims to demonstrate that stars adhere to a discernible pattern, specifically manifested in the HR-Diagram. This diagram serves as the foundation for classifying stars by plotting their features, offering valuable insights into their characteristics.
